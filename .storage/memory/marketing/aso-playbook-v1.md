## 3. Metadata Strategy

### iOS App Store

#### App Name (30 chars - DO NOT CHANGE)
```
Regimen: Peptide & TRT Tracker
```

#### Subtitle (30 chars - KEEP CURRENT)
```
Injection Log & Calculator
```

#### Keywords (100 chars - UPDATE IN BUILD 34/35)
```
testosterone,semaglutide,tirzepatide,retatrutide,injection,steroids,reconstitution,log,protocol,dose
```

#### Keyword Rationale

| Keyword | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| `testosterone` | Captures TRT audience (not "trt" - already in name) |
| `semaglutide` | GLP-1 drug name for discoverability |
| `tirzepatide` | GLP-1 drug name for discoverability |
| `retatrutide` | Emerging GLP-1 compound |
| `injection` | Action term for "injection log" compound |
| `steroids` | Captures steroid tracker searches |
| `reconstitution` | Targets calculator searches (combined with subtitle) |
| `log` | Compounds with testosterone/injection/peptide |
| `protocol` | TRT community terminology |
| `dose` | Utility term for calculator intent |

#### Words NOT in Keywords (indexed via Name/Subtitle)
- regimen, peptide, trt, tracker (from Name)
- injection, log, calculator (from Subtitle)

### Google Play Store

#### App Name (30 chars)
```
Regimen: Peptide & TRT Tracker
```

#### Short Description (80 chars)
```
Track TRT, peptides & GLP-1 injections. Reconstitution calculator & reminders.
```

#### Full Description (First Paragraph - Keyword Optimized)
```
Regimen is the all-in-one injection tracker and log for TRT, peptides, and GLP-1 medications like semaglutide and tirzepatide. Whether you're managing a testosterone protocol, cycling research peptides like BPC-157 or TB-500, or tracking your weight loss journey on Ozempic or Mounjaro, Regimen helps you stay consistent with smart reminders, a built-in reconstitution calculator, and detailed logging.

## 4. Google Play ASO Strategy

### Key Differences from iOS

| Aspect | iOS App Store | Google Play |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Hidden keyword field | ✅ Yes (100 chars) | ❌ No |
| Title indexed | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Subtitle/Short desc indexed | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Full description indexed | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (critical!) |
| Keyword density matters | N/A | ✅ Yes |

### Google Play Optimization Tips

1. **Full description is SEO-critical** - Unlike iOS, every word in the full description is indexed by Google Play
2. **Natural keyword integration** - Include target keywords naturally throughout the description
3. **First paragraph matters most** - Front-load the most important keywords
4. **No keyword stuffing** - Google penalizes obvious keyword stuffing
5. **Update regularly** - Fresh descriptions can boost rankings

### Target Keywords for Google Play
Include these naturally in the full description:
- testosterone, TRT, injection tracker, injection log
- peptide tracker, peptide log, reconstitution calculator
- semaglutide, tirzepatide, Ozempic, Mounjaro
- protocol, cycle, reminder, dose

## 11. Strategic Insights

### Why "Log" Keywords Are Golden
- Lower competition than "tracker" keywords
- Same user intent (people want to track)
- Compounds well with drug names (testosterone log, injection log)

### Why Reconstitution Calculator Is Best Opportunity
- Highest traffic (46) of untapped keywords
- Medium difficulty (40) = achievable
- Calculator is already in subtitle
- Content marketing can boost organic ranking

### Conversion Insights
- TRT/power peptide users convert 3x better than single-compound GLP-1 users
- Focus ASO on high-intent "log" and "protocol" terms
- De-prioritize brand keywords (Ozempic, Mounjaro) - low conversion
