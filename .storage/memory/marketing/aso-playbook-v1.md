## 2. Metadata Strategy

### App Name (30 chars - DO NOT CHANGE)
```
Regimen: Peptide & TRT Tracker
```

### Subtitle (30 chars - KEEP CURRENT)
```
Injection Log & Calculator
```

### Keywords (100 chars - UPDATE IN BUILD 34/35)
```
testosterone,semaglutide,tirzepatide,retatrutide,injection,steroids,reconstitution,log,protocol,dose
```

### Keyword Rationale

| Keyword | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| `testosterone` | Captures TRT audience (not "trt" - already in name) |
| `semaglutide` | GLP-1 drug name for discoverability |
| `tirzepatide` | GLP-1 drug name for discoverability |
| `retatrutide` | Emerging GLP-1 compound |
| `injection` | Action term for "injection log" compound |
| `steroids` | Captures steroid tracker searches |
| `reconstitution` | Targets calculator searches (combined with subtitle) |
| `log` | Compounds with testosterone/injection/peptide |
| `protocol` | TRT community terminology |
| `dose` | Utility term for calculator intent |

### Words NOT in Keywords (indexed via Name/Subtitle)
- regimen, peptide, trt, tracker (from Name)
- injection, log, calculator (from Subtitle)

## 9. Strategic Insights

### Why "Log" Keywords Are Golden
- Lower competition than "tracker" keywords
- Same user intent (people want to track)
- Compounds well with drug names (testosterone log, injection log)

### Why Reconstitution Calculator Is Best Opportunity
- Highest traffic (46) of untapped keywords
- Medium difficulty (40) = achievable
- Calculator is already in subtitle
- Content marketing can boost organic ranking

### Conversion Insights
- TRT/power peptide users convert 3x better than single-compound GLP-1 users
- Focus ASO on high-intent "log" and "protocol" terms
- De-prioritize brand keywords (Ozempic, Mounjaro) - low conversion
