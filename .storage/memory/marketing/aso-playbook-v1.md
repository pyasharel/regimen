```

#### Keywords (100 chars - UPDATE IN BUILD 34/35)
```
testosterone,semaglutide,tirzepatide,retatrutide,injection,steroids,reconstitution,log,protocol,dose

| `dose` | Utility term for calculator intent |

#### Words NOT in Keywords (indexed via Name/Subtitle)
- regimen, peptide, trt, tracker (from Name)
- injection, log, calculator (from Subtitle)

### Google Play Store

TRACK YOUR PROTOCOL. SEE REAL RESULTS.

Regimen is the #1 injection tracker and log for peptides, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), GLP-1 weight loss medications, and HRT. Whether you're managing a simple weekly injection or a complex multi-compound stack, Regimen helps you stay consistent and see the transformation you're working toward.

WHAT YOU CAN TRACK

- Peptides (BPC-157, TB-500, GHK-Cu, CJC-1295, Ipamorelin, PT-141, and more)
- GLP-1 medications (Semaglutide, Tirzepatide, Retatrutide, Ozempic, Mounjaro, Wegovy, Zepbound)
- Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT)
- Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for women
- Performance and anabolic compounds
- Oral medications, nasal sprays, and any compound with a dosing schedule
- Custom medications — add anything not in our database

Track doses in mg, mcg, IU, mL, pills, or sprays. Fully customizable for your exact protocol.

BUILT-IN RECONSTITUTION & DOSE CALCULATORS

- Peptide reconstitution calculator: enter vial size, BAC water, and intended dose — get exact IU/units to draw
- Reverse calculator: enter your water amount and get your dosage per unit
- Oil-based mL calculator for testosterone and other injectable oils
- Works for any compound in mg, mcg, or IU

CUSTOM SCHEDULING & INJECTION REMINDERS

Set your dosing frequency exactly how you need it:
- Daily dosing
- Twice weekly (every 3.5 days)
- Weekly injections
- Every X days (every 3 days, every 5 days, etc.)
- Specific days (Mon/Wed/Fri)
- Custom cycles with rest periods
- As-needed protocols

Get injection reminders so you never miss a dose during your cycle.

TRACK PROGRESS THAT MATTERS

Log weight, take progress photos, track energy and sleep. See exactly what's working by correlating your results with your active compounds. No more guessing which protocol actually helped you reach your goals.

VISUALIZE MEDICATION LEVELS

See compound levels in your system with half-life plotting. Understand when your medications are most active and plan dosing around peak effectiveness.

MANAGE YOUR ENTIRE STACK

Track multiple compounds simultaneously. Each with its own schedule, cycle duration, and rest periods. Everything organized in one place.

COMPREHENSIVE MEDICATION DATABASE

Browse our built-in database of peptides, GLP-1s, testosterone, HRT, and performance compounds — or add your own custom medications. Track anything from research peptides to daily prescriptions.

WHAT USERS ARE SAYING

"Being able to track multiple compounds with different schedules in one app is exactly what I needed." — iOS user

BUILT FOR

- Peptide users optimizing recovery and performance

- Women on HRT managing hormone balance
- Anyone serious about protocol optimization and seeing real results

## 4. Google Play ASO Strategy

### Key Differences from iOS

| Aspect | iOS App Store | Google Play |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Hidden keyword field | ✅ Yes (100 chars) | ❌ No |
| Title indexed | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Subtitle/Short desc indexed | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Full description indexed | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (critical!) |

### Google Play Optimization Tips

1. **Full description is SEO-critical** - Unlike iOS, every word in the full description is indexed by Google Play
2. **Natural keyword integration** - Include target keywords naturally throughout the description

4. **No keyword stuffing** - Google penalizes obvious keyword stuffing
5. **Update regularly** - Fresh descriptions can boost rankings

### Target Keywords for Google Play
Include these naturally in the full description:
- testosterone, TRT, injection tracker, injection log
- peptide tracker, peptide log, reconstitution calculator
- semaglutide, tirzepatide, Ozempic, Mounjaro
- protocol, cycle, reminder, dose

## 11. Strategic Insights

### Why "Log" Keywords Are Golden
- Lower competition than "tracker" keywords
- Same user intent (people want to track)
- Compounds well with drug names (testosterone log, injection log)

### Why Reconstitution Calculator Is Best Opportunity
- Highest traffic (46) of untapped keywords
- Medium difficulty (40) = achievable
- Calculator is already in subtitle
- Content marketing can boost organic ranking

### Conversion Insights
- TRT/power peptide users convert 3x better than single-compound GLP-1 users
- Focus ASO on high-intent "log" and "protocol" terms
- De-prioritize brand keywords (Ozempic, Mounjaro) - low conversion
