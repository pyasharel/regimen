# ASO Metadata Strategy for v1.0.3

## Final Recommendations

### Name (No Change)
```
Regimen: Peptide & TRT Tracker
```
- 30 characters, optimized
- Covers peptide + TRT audiences

### Subtitle (Update)
```
Ozempic & Mounjaro Calculator
```
- Targets high-volume GLP-1 brand searches
- "Calculator" = high-intent functional term
- Combined with name, covers all user segments

### Keywords (100 characters - NO DUPLICATES)
```
semaglutide,tirzepatide,testosterone,injection,bpc157,retatrutide,shotsy,reminder,shot,glp1,protocol
```

**Keyword Strategy:**
- `semaglutide`, `tirzepatide`: Drug names (high intent)
- `testosterone`: TRT audience (not duplicated, "trt" is in name)
- `injection`, `shot`: Action terms
- `bpc157`, `retatrutide`: Niche compounds (high intent)
- `shotsy`: Competitor name (aggressive traffic capture)
- `reminder`: Functional search term
- `glp1`: Technical term some users search
- `protocol`: TRT community terminology

### Words NOT in Keywords (already indexed via Name/Subtitle)
- regimen, peptide, trt, tracker (from Name)
- ozempic, mounjaro, calculator (from Subtitle)

## Implementation Notes
- Wait for v1.0.2 approval before changing Name/Subtitle
- Keywords can be updated with v1.0.3 submission
- Competitor keyword risk is low (keywords are private)

## Updated
January 2025 - Fixed duplicate keyword issue
