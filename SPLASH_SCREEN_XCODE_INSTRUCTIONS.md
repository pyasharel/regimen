# Splash Screen Setup - Next Steps

## ✅ Files Created
I've created the splash screen files in the iOS project:
- `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/Splash.imageset/splash-screen.png`
- `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/Splash.imageset/splash-screen@2x.png`
- `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/Splash.imageset/splash-screen@3x.png`
- `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/Splash.imageset/Contents.json`

## Next Steps (In Xcode)

1. **Sync the iOS project**:
   ```bash
   npx cap sync ios
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**:
   ```bash
   npx cap open ios
   ```

3. **Verify the splash screen**:
   - Navigate to: `App > App > Assets.xcassets > Splash.imageset`
   - You should see the three splash screen images (1x, 2x, 3x)
   - All three images are identical - this is normal

4. **Build and Run**:
   - Clean Build Folder: `Product → Clean Build Folder`
   - Build and run the app
   - The splash screen will now show your Regimen branding!

## Push Notifications Setup

Looking at your Xcode screenshot, you have "Remote notifications" enabled under Background Modes, but you also need to add the "Push Notifications" capability:

1. In Xcode, with your App target selected
2. Go to: `Signing & Capabilities` tab
3. Click the `+ Capability` button (top left)
4. Search for "Push Notifications"
5. Add it to your project

This is separate from "Remote notifications" in Background Modes - you need both for push notifications to work properly.

## Animation (Optional)

If you want to add animation to the splash screen (fade in/out, zoom, etc.), you would need to:
1. Modify the `capacitor.config.ts` file
2. Or create a custom splash screen plugin

The simplest approach is to keep the current setup, which shows the splash for 2 seconds as configured in `capacitor.config.ts`.
