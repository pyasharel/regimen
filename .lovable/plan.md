# Update ASO Playbook with Google Play Strategy

## Overview
Add Google Play Store information and Android-specific ASO strategies to the existing ASO Playbook document, making it a comprehensive cross-platform ASO reference.

## Changes to Make

### 1. Add Store URLs Section (New Section after Section 1)
Insert a new section with both store URLs for easy reference:
- **iOS App Store**: `https://apps.apple.com/app/regimen-peptide-trt-tracker/id6746762847`
- **Google Play Store**: `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.lovable.regimen`

### 2. Expand Section 2: Metadata Strategy
Restructure to include both platforms:

**iOS App Store Metadata** (existing content):
- Name: `Regimen: Peptide & TRT Tracker`
- Subtitle: `Injection Log & Calculator`
- Keywords: (existing 100-char string)

**Google Play Metadata** (new):
- App Name: `Regimen: Peptide & TRT Tracker`
- Short Description: `Track TRT, peptides & GLP-1 injections. Reconstitution calculator & reminders.`
- Full Description: Include the keyword-optimized first paragraph you submitted

### 3. Add Google Play ASO Section (New Section)
Create a dedicated section explaining Google Play ASO differences:
- No hidden keyword field (all text is indexed)
- Full description is critical for SEO
- App name has 30-character limit (same as iOS)
- Short description has 80-character limit

### 4. Update Growth Milestones (Section 7)
Mark "Launch Android from closed beta" as complete and add Android-specific goals:
- [x] Launch Android from closed beta
- [ ] Reach 10 Google Play reviews
- [ ] Monitor Google Play Console for early performance data

### 5. Update Priority Stack (Section 8)
Add new items:
- Request Google Play reviews from Android beta testers
- Monitor Play Console for crashes/ANRs
- Cross-promote Android launch to iOS users

### 6. Update Changelog (Section 10)
Add entry for February 7, 2026:
