# Engagement Features Implementation

## ✅ Streaks System

### Database
- **Table**: `user_stats`
  - Tracks `current_streak`, `longest_streak`, `last_check_in_date`, `total_doses_logged`
  - Auto-updates via trigger when doses are marked as taken
  - Lenient logic: ≥1 dose per day = streak continues
  - Retroactive check-ins count (can save streaks)

### UI Components
1. **StreakBadge** (Today Screen - Top Right)
   - Small fire emoji 🔥 badge
   - Shows after day 2
   - Displays current streak number

2. **StreakCard** (Progress Screen - Top)
   - Large fire icon with current streak
   - Longest streak + total doses logged stats
   - Milestone progress bar (7, 14, 30, 60, 90 days)
   - Encouraging messages based on status
   - Shows "missed streak" message if broken

### Milestones
- 🔥 3 days: "3 day streak!"
- 🎯 7 days: "One week strong!"
- 💪 14 days: "Two weeks of excellence!"
- 🏆 30 days: "30 DAYS! You're a champion!"
- ⚡ 60 days: "60 DAYS! Transformation mode!"
- 👑 90 days: "90 DAYS! Ultimate discipline!"
